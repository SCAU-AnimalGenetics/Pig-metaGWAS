# Analysis pipelines for meta-GWAS

## 1. Introduction

As an essential part of the ongoing Farm animal Genotype-Tissue Expression (FarmGTEx) - PigGTEx (http://piggtex.farmgtex.org/) project, the meta-GWAS aims to build a a comprehensive public catalogue of genetic association map for complex traits in pigs from diverse regional distribution. This resources will be updated every 2-3 years together with PigGTEx project. The meta-GWAS will serve as a valuable resource for pig basic biological discovery, pig genetics, breeding, biotechnology, domestication, veterinary and human biomedicine research.



## 2. Analysis pipelines

This repository contains analysis pipelines used in meta-GWAS, including:

- Genotype imputation and quality control

- Deregressed proofs calculation and individual GWAS analyses
- Meta-level quality control for summary statistics of individual GWASs
- Meta-GWAS analysis and QTL defining
- Calculate the posterior probability that lead SNP has an effect in each study
- QTL validation and genomic prediction on breed
- Functional annotation and enrichment (snpEff, chromatin state, genomic categories, conserved elements, tissue-specific functional regions)
- Genetic parameter estimation based on GWAS summary and heritability enrichment for molecular QTL

- Comparative analysis between pig and human

Pipeline components are public available in this repository and execution scripts are provided in snakemake workflow (.smk).
